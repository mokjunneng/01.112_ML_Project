I
wrote
on
a
midterm
Zeus
was
born
on
Crete
.
That's
the
only
Greek
Island
I
remember
.
I
was
right
.
I
love
when
things
work
out

Easily
said
by
a
man
reveling
in
White
Male
Privilege
.
Kudos
to
these
women
for
their
courage

How
long
before
desperate
Brits
start
liquidising
Twiglets

a
taste
of
Marmite
?
You

God

Still
shocked
that
Craig
will
actually
eat
apples
even
though
they're
not
fries
or
pizza

Not
having

is
killing
me
